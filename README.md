# 2018FinancialAnalysis
Includes the Jupyter notebook of the code and analysis carried out for a Medium blog post.

## Medium post

## Installations
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- matplotlib

No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivations
In this project I wanted to explore the a dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018/kernels

The purpose is for my own personal upskill in exploratory data analysis, data science and communicating about the two. I picked three questions to use the dataset to answer, the results of which are summarised below and explained more in the Medium post.

## Summary of results
- The best performing sector, in terms of percentage growth of share price in 2019, was Technology
- An increase in spending on R&D for technology companies in 2018 did not correlate to an increase in share price in 2019. Rather, the data was quiet scattered.
- The best and worst performing sectors differed te most on EPS (Earnings Per Share) and Book Value Per Share, the two buildings blocks of a simple metric from Benjamin Graham to define the 'fundamental value' of a stock.

## File Descriptions
The Jupyter notebook contains the code used to carry out the analysis for the medium post linked above.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Only relevant licensing is the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebook.
I wish to acknowledge the Kaggle user who uploaded the data: Nicolas Carbone.
I wrote all of the code myself (with excessive Googling help).
