## Project Motivations
In this project I wanted to explore a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018/kernels) relating to the stock market. The purpose is for my own personal upskill in exploratory data analysis, data science and communicating about the two. I picked three questions to use the dataset to answer, the results of which are summarised below and explained more in the Medium post.

## Medium post

* [US Stock in 2018: Back When It Wasn't All Crashing]( https://medium.com/@tombutler11044/us-stocks-in-2018-back-when-it-wasnt-all-crashing-b710f79505cc) - this was written in March 2020. It all absolutely was crashing in that month.
* To be written Medium blog post on a machine learning algorithm for this work

## Summary of results

### Data Exploration
- The best performing sector, in terms of percentage growth of share price in 2019, was Technology
- An increase in spending on R&D for technology companies in 2018 did not correlate to an increase in share price in 2019. Rather, the data was quiet scattered.
- The best and worst performing sectors differed te most on EPS (Earnings Per Share) and Book Value Per Share, the two buildings blocks of a simple metric from Benjamin Graham to define the 'fundamental value' of a stock.

### Machine Learning Model

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Only relevant licensing is the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebook.
I wish to acknowledge the Kaggle user who uploaded the data: Nicolas Carbone.
I wrote all of the code myself (with excessive Googling help).
